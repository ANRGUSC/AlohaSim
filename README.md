# AlohaSim
A very simple slotted Aloha simulator written in Python

Suitable for undergraduate students to tinker with and understand the throughput performance of Slotted Aloha as a function of the transmission probability. 
Used for illustrating the concept in a class at USC (EE 250, Spring 2021) 

The initial version implements only two users and the same transmission probability for all users, 
can be extended to consider multiple users and heterogeneous probabilities.
